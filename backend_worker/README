BACKEND WORKER (AI Processor)
This directory contains the Python application for the backend processing engine. This service runs as a headless, containerized application whose sole responsibility is to perform the AI-powered analysis of resumes.

Core Logic (main.py):
Listens to SQS: Continuously polls the AWS SQS queue for new messages.

Downloads from S3: Upon receiving a message, it downloads the corresponding resume file from the AWS S3 bucket.

Parses Text: Extracts raw text from .pdf or .docx files.

Semantic Scoring:

Loads a pre-trained NLP model from the sentence-transformers library.

Converts the resume text and the job description into numerical vector embeddings.

Calculates the cosine similarity between the vectors to generate a match score.

Updates Database: Connects to the AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) database and updates the resume record with the calculated score.

Containerization:
The Dockerfile in this directory packages the application and its dependencies into a portable Docker container. The download_model.py script is run during the build process to pre-cache the AI model, ensuring fast startup times for the container.
