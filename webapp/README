WEB APPLICATION (Frontend)
This directory contains the user-facing web application built with the Flask framework in Python. It provides the dashboard for recruiters to interact with the system.

Core Responsibilities (app.py):
Render Dashboard: Fetches job and candidate data from the AWS RDS database (via db.py) and displays it on a user-friendly HTML template (templates/dashboard.html).

Handle File Uploads: Provides an endpoint for recruiters to upload resume files.

Trigger Backend Process: After receiving a file, the application performs two key actions:

Uploads the resume file directly to the AWS S3 bucket.

Sends a JSON message to the AWS SQS queue, which triggers the backend worker to begin processing.

This decoupled approach ensures the web application remains fast and responsive, regardless of how many resumes are being processed in the background.

Containerization:
The Dockerfile in this directory packages the Flask application to run with a production-ready gunicorn web server inside a Docker container.
